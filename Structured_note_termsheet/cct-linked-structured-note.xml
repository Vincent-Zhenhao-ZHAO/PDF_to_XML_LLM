That is, the Offering Circular has not been registered as a prospectus with the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Accordingly, the Offering Circular, this Termsheet, the Conditions Supplement and any other document or material in connection with the offer or sale, or invitation for subscription or purchase, of Notes may not be circulated or distributed, nor may Notes be offered or sold, or be made the subject of an invitation for subscription or purchase, whether directly or indirectly, to persons in Singapore other than (i) to an institutional investor under Section 274 of the SFA, (ii) to a relevant person pursuant to Section 275(1), or any person pursuant to Section 275(1A), and in accordance with the conditions specified in Section 275 of the SFA, or (iii) otherwise pursuant to, and in accordance with the conditions of, any other applicable provision of the SFA. </P><P>Where the Notes are subscribed or purchased under Section 275 by a relevant person which is:  </P><L><LI><LBody>(a) a corporation (which is not an accredited investor (as defined in Section 4A of the SFA)) the sole business of which is to hold investments and the entire share capital of which is owned by one or more individuals, each of whom is an accredited investor; or </LBody></LI><LI><LBody>(b) a trust (where the trustee is not an accredited investor) whose sole purpose is to hold investments and each beneficiary of the trust is an individual who is an accredited investor, </LBody></LI></L><P>securities (as defined in Section 239(1) of the SFA) of that corporation or the beneficiaries’ rights and interest (howsoever described) in that trust shall not be transferred within six months after that corporation or that trust has acquired the Notes pursuant to an offer made under Section 275 except: </P><P>(a)  to an institutional investor or to a relevant person defined in Section 275(2) of the SFA, or to any person arising from an offer referred to in Section 275(1A) or Section 276(4)(i)(B) of the SFA; </P><P>(b) where no consideration is or will be given for the transfer;    </P><P>(c) where the transfer is by operation of law;  </P><P>(d) as specified in Section 276(7) of the SFA; or </P><P>(e) as specified in Regulation 32 of the Securities and Futures (Offers of Investments) (Shares and Debentures) Regulations 2005 of Singapore.  </P><P>Noteholders should take note of the above on-selling restrictions. </P><P> </P><P>In respect of Notes offered outside of Singapore, the Notes are being offered and sold by the Issuer pursuant to the exemption(s) from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements under the applicable laws and regulations of the relevant jurisdiction.  No </P></TD></TR></TBody></Table><Table><TBody><TR><TD/><TD><P>action has been taken by the Issuer that would permit the Notes to be offered or sold, or any offering materials relating to the Notes to be possessed or distributed, in any jurisdiction where action for that purpose is required.  No purchase, offer, sale, resale or delivery of the Notes or distribution of any offering materials relating to the Notes may be made in or from any jurisdiction except in circumstances which will result in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and which will not impose any obligation on the Issuer. </P><P> </P><P>In respect of Notes offered outside of Singapore, the Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (the “EEA”).  </P><P>For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of:  </P><P>(i)  a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, &quot;MiFID II&quot;); or  </P><P>(ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2002/92/EC (as amended the &quot;Insurance Mediation Directive&quot;), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or  </P><P>(iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Directive 2003/71/EC (as amended, the &quot;Prospectus Directive&quot;).  </P><P>Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (the &quot;PRIIPs Regulation&quot;) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPS Regulation. </P><P> </P></TD></TR><TR><TD><P>Terms of Sale: </P></TD><TD><P>The Notes are being sold to the investor on a principal to principal basis for the investor’s own account.   </P></TD></TR><TR><TD><P>Buy Back Arrangements: </P></TD><TD><P>The investor may request the Issuer to buy back the Notes with a minimum buy back amount of at least 1 Note and subsequent integral multiples of 1 Note, by submitting a written request to the Issuer. </P><P>The investor’s request to sell the Notes must be submitted to the Issuer no later than 1:00 p.m. Singapore time on the day of the intended sale that is a Scheduled Trading Day (the “Buy-Back Date”).  </P><P>The Note Executed Price for the Notes will be determined by the Market Agent at its sole discretion at the relevant time on the Buy-Back Date, and notified to the investor as soon as practicable after the later of the Scheduled Closing Times of the Exchanges. In respect of each Note, the Issuer will pay the Note Executed Price to the Noteholder no later than three Payment Days after the relevant Buy-Back Date.  </P><P>For avoidance of doubt, the Note Executed Price determined by the Market Agent may differ from the indicative bid price of the Notes quoted by the Issuer (if any). To the extent that the Issuer is prevented for any reason whatsoever from dealing in the Underlying Equity, </P></TD></TR></TBody></Table><Table><TBody><TR><TD/><TD><P>investors’ requests to sell the Notes will be effected on a “first-come-first-served” basis.  </P></TD></TR><TR><TD><P>Disruption of a Buy-Back Date: </P></TD><TD><P>If a Buy-Back Date on which the Note Executed Price is to be determined is a Disrupted Day, the Market Agent will determine the Note Executed Price on the first succeeding Scheduled Trading Day that is not a Disrupted Day. </P></TD></TR><TR><TD><P>Market Agent: </P></TD><TD><P>DBS Bank Ltd. </P></TD></TR><TR><TD><P>Further Issues: </P></TD><TD><P>The investor should note that the Issuer has the right to issue further notes from time to time so as to be consolidated and form a single Series with the Notes pursuant to Condition 19. </P></TD></TR></TBody></Table><P> </P><P> </P><H1>ADDITIONAL RISK FACTORS </H1><P>In addition to the risk factors mentioned in the section on “Risk Factors” in the Offering Circular, the investor should also consider the following additional risk factors in relation to the Notes. </P><P> </P><Table><TBody><TR><TD><P>Not a traditional deposit </P><L><LI><LBody> The Notes carry risks not normally associated with ordinary bank deposits. The investor should therefore not treat the Notes as a substitute for ordinary savings or time deposits.  </LBody></LI><LI><LBody> The Notes are not equivalent to a time deposit and are not a protected deposit by the Deposit Protection Scheme in Hong Kong or by any other similar scheme in any country.  </LBody></LI></L><P>Suitability </P><L><LI><LBody> A prospective investor in any equity-linked Notes should be experienced with dealing in these types of products and should understand the risks associated with dealing in such products. A prospective investor should reach an investment decision only after careful consideration, with advisers (where appropriate), of the suitability of the Notes in light of the investor’s particular financial position, experience, objectives and other relevant circumstances, the information regarding the Notes, the particular Underlying Equity to which the Notes relate, any related transaction costs, and the creditworthiness of the Issuer. </LBody></LI></L><P>Market Risks </P><L><LI><LBody> Investing in equity-linked Notes involves market risk. Changes in the price, level or value of the Underlying Equity can be unpredictable, sudden and large. Such changes may result in the price or value of the Notes moving adversely to the interests of the investor and negatively impacting upon the return on, or redemption of, the Notes.  In extreme circumstances, the investor may lose all, or a significant proportion of, the original investment. </LBody></LI><LI><LBody> The Issuer and/or its affiliates may enter into hedging transactions in the market to enable the Issuer to fulfill its obligations under the Notes. These transactions typically involve contracts for the purchase and/or sale of the Underlying Equity and the establishment of long and/or short positions in the Underlying Equity which may be constantly adjusted. The unwinding or adjustment of the positions in the Underlying Equity shortly before a fixing date may affect the closing market price of the relevant Underlying Equity recorded on such date, particularly if there is otherwise low trading volume in the relevant Underlying Equity at that time. It is thus possible that this activity could affect the closing market price of the relevant Underlying Equity, whether by pushing it down to a level below or up above the relevant stipulated benchmark (as the case may be) or otherwise, resulting in the Final Redemption Amount being less than the original investment amount or no payment of interest or other return, or a reduced return. </LBody></LI><LI><LBody> The investor takes the risk that he may not receive 100 per cent. of the original investment amount on the Maturity Date.  </LBody></LI><LI><LBody> Investor’s attention is drawn to the following (which is not exhaustive): </LBody></LI></L><P>(i) No interest in the Underlying Equity. The Notes are debentures and do not confer on or transfer to investors any right to or interest in the Underlying Equity during the term of the Notes. Investors will therefore not be entitled to enjoy any shareholder or unitholder entitlement during the tenor of the Notes. </P><P>(ii) Credit Risk of the Equity Issuer. As the value of the Notes is directly linked to the </P></TD></TR></TBody></Table><Table><TBody><TR><TD><P>performance of the Underlying Equity, investors are subject to the credit risk of the Equity Issuer to the extent that the value of the Underlying Equity may be affected by the activities undertaken by the Equity Issuer or any financial or economic difficulties the Equity Issuer may face. A change in the value of the Underlying Equity will directly affect the value of the Notes. </P><L><LI><LBody> Market Access Notes. The Notes are structured as market access notes. This means that although investors do not have any interest in the Underlying Equity, investors are nevertheless subject to all risks relating to the Underlying Equity (including but not limited to illiquidity and trading suspension of the Underlying Equity, equity price risk etc.) as of the Issue Date.  </LBody></LI><LI><LBody> Extension of Maturity Date. The Issuer has a right (which may be exercised more than once, by giving not less than 5 Business Days’ prior written notice to Noteholders) to extend the Maturity Date to such later date after the original scheduled maturity date and in such circumstance, investors will only receive their Final Redemption Amount on such later maturity date.  </LBody></LI></L><P>Liquidity Risks </P><L><LI><LBody> Unless otherwise specified, the Notes will not be listed or traded on any exchange or other regulated market. No assurance can be given that any secondary trading market will develop for the Notes. Even if a secondary market for the Notes develops, it may not provide the investor with liquidity. </LBody></LI><LI><LBody> While there is no absolute obligation on the Market Agent or the Issuer to purchase the Notes, the Market Agent and the Issuer intend to follow the “Buy Back Arrangements” provisions under the Notes. </LBody></LI><LI><LBody> Early redemption of the Notes will be at the Issuer’s sole and absolute discretion and the investor should note that the amount received upon early redemption will usually be substantially less than the original investment amount. </LBody></LI><LI><LBody> THE INVESTOR SHOULD INTEND TO MAINTAIN HIS INTEREST IN THE NOTES UP TO THE MATURITY DATE.  </LBody></LI></L><P>Buy back Arrangements </P><L><LI><LBody> The Market Agent may quote an indicative bid price for the Notes when the investor requests the Market Agent to buy back the Notes. The price at which such buy-back will take place is the Note Executed Price. If a Buy-Back Date on which the Note Executed Price is to be determined is a Disrupted Day, then unless the Note Executed Price has already been determined in accordance with the terms of the Notes, the Market Agent will determine the Note Executed Price on the first succeeding Scheduled Trading Day that is not a Disrupted Day. </LBody></LI></L><P>Potential Adjustment Events, Extraordinary Events and Disrupted Day  </P><L><LI><LBody> If certain Potential Adjustment Events or Extraordinary Events occur, the Calculation Agent may be required or, as the case may be, permitted to make certain adjustments or amendments to the terms and conditions of the Notes. However, the Calculation Agent is not required to make an adjustment for every such event.   </LBody></LI><LI><LBody> In the case of Extraordinary Events, if the Calculation Agent determines that no adjustment that it could make will produce a commercially reasonable result, the Issuer will redeem all outstanding Notes, at the Early Redemption Amount. The Early Redemption Amount is likely to be substantially less than the original amount invested. </LBody></LI><LI><LBody> Extraordinary Events include a Hedging Disruption. The Issuer may, from time to time, be restricted from dealing in certain stocks in compliance with applicable law, including any applicable code on take-overs and mergers.  Given that the Issuer is an associated </LBody></LI></L></TD></TR></TBody></Table><Table><TBody><TR><TD><L><LI><LBody>company of Temasek Holdings Private Limited (“Temasek”) and the holdings of the Issuer in any stocks may have to be aggregated with the holdings of Temasek and its numerous concert parties as defined in any applicable law (which may include its subsidiaries and associated companies) in such stocks, the Issuer may be more susceptible to restrictions in dealing in stocks. A Hedging Disruption may therefore be more likely to occur in respect of the Notes. </LBody></LI><LI><LBody> If the Valuation Date is a Disrupted Day: (i) the Actual Executed Price of the Underlying Equity shall be fixed on the first succeeding Scheduled Trading Day that is not a Disrupted Day, and (ii) if each of the eight Scheduled Trading Days immediately following the original date is a Disrupted Day, the Calculation Agent shall determine its good faith estimate of the Actual Executed Price of the Underlying Equity on that eighth Scheduled Trading Day. Where the Valuation Date is a Disrupted Day, the Maturity Date will also be postponed to the [third] Payment Day following such postponed Valuation Date. The investor will not be entitled to receive any further interest or compensation in respect of such postponement.  </LBody></LI><LI><LBody> If the Initial Price Fixing Date is a Disrupted Day:  (i) the Initial Price of the Underlying Equity shall be determined on the first succeeding Scheduled Trading Day that is not a Disrupted Day, and (ii) if each of the eight Scheduled Trading Days immediately following that Scheduled Initial Price Fixing Date is a Disrupted Day, the Issuer will redeem all Notes pursuant to the provisions under “Mandatory Redemption” above. If the Initial Price Fixing Date cannot be determined on or before the eighth Scheduled Trading Day immediately following the Scheduled Initial Price Fixing Date pursuant to the “Initial Price Fixing Date” provisions above, the Issuer will redeem all outstanding Notes by paying the Mandatory Redemption Amount to the Noteholder no later than the Mandatory Redemption Date. Upon the occurrence of such mandatory redemption by the Issuer, the Noteholder shall have no other or further rights against the Issuer after the Mandatory Redemption Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the Noteholder will not be entitled to receive any Final Redemption Amount after the Mandatory Redemption Date. </LBody></LI></L><P>Credit risk </P><L><LI><LBody> The Notes are not secured by any collateral. </LBody></LI><LI><LBody> The investor is taking on the credit risk of DBS Bank Ltd. (“Bank”) (Moody’s Aa1, S&amp;P AA-, Fitch AA-) with respect to all payments due under the Notes. The investor should not solely rely on the long-term credit ratings of the Issuer when evaluating its creditworthiness. There is no assurance that the Issuer’s long-term credit ratings as set out in this document will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be revised, suspended or withdrawn in the future if, in the relevant credit rating agency’s judgment, the circumstances so warrant. In the worst case scenario, where the Issuer becomes insolvent, the investor will lose his original investment amount. </LBody></LI></L><P> </P><P>Risk in respect of REITs </P><L><LI><LBody> The investment objective of real estate investment trust (“REITs”) is to invest in a real estate portfolio. Each REIT is exposed to risks relating to investments in real estate, including but not limited to (a) adverse changes in political or economic conditions, (b) changes in interest rates and the availability of debt or equity financing, which may result in an inability by the REIT to maintain or improve the real estate portfolio and finance future acquisitions, (c) changes in environmental, zoning and other governmental rules, (d) changes in market rents, (e) any required repair and maintenance of the portfolio properties, (f) breach of any property laws or regulations, (g) the relative illiquidity of real estate investments, (h) real estate taxes, (i) any hidden interests in the portfolio properties, (j) any increase in insurance premiums and (k) any </LBody></LI></L></TD></TR></TBody></Table><Table><TBody><TR><TD><L><LI><LBody>uninsurable losses. </LBody></LI><LI><LBody> There may also be disparity between the market price of the units of a REIT and the net asset value per unit. This is because the market price of the units of a REIT also depends on many factors, including but not limited to (i) the market value and perceived prospects of the real estate portfolio, (ii) changes in economic or market conditions, (iii) changes in market valuations of similar companies, (iv) changes in interest rates, (v) the perceived attractiveness of the units of the REIT against those of other equity securities, (vi) the future size and liquidity of the market for the units and the REIT market generally, (vii) any future changes to the regulatory system, including the tax system and (viii) the ability of the REIT to implement its investment and growth strategies and to retain its key personnel. Such risks may have a negative impact on the performance of the units of the REIT and the potential return of the structured notes. </LBody></LI><LI><LBody> Please refer to the relevant REIT offering documents for further information about the risks applicable to the REIT. </LBody></LI></L><P> </P><P>Past Performance </P><L><LI><LBody> Past performance of the relevant Underlying Equity is not necessarily a guide as to the future performance of the Notes. The value of the Notes can go down as well as up. </LBody></LI></L><P>Potential and Actual Conflicts of Interest </P><L><LI><LBody> The Issuer plays a variety of roles in relation to the Notes, including acting as issuer of the Notes and Calculation Agent and hedging its obligations under the Notes. The Issuer and/or its subsidiaries and affiliates may also enter into, adjust and unwind transactions relating to the relevant Underlying Equity, whether for its or their proprietary accounts or for accounts under management or to facilitate transactions on behalf of customers or otherwise. In carrying out these roles, the Issuer’s economic interests and those of its subsidiaries and affiliates may be potentially against any investor’s interests under the Notes. </LBody></LI></L><P>Tenor of the Notes </P><L><LI><LBody> A prospective investor should be satisfied with the entire tenor of the Notes and should note that Notes with a longer tenor will be associated with higher risks and usually involve higher cost of early exit if buy back arrangements are available or if early redemption is permitted.  </LBody></LI></L><P> </P></TD></TR></TBody></Table><P> </P></Part></TaggedPDF-doc>
