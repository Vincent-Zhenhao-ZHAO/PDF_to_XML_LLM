That is, the Offering Circular has not been registered as a prospectus with the Monetary Authority of Singapore.

        <TermsOfSale>The Notes are being sold to the investor on a principal to principal basis for the investor’s own account</TermsOfSale>
        <BuyBackArrangements>The investor may request the Issuer to buy back the Notes with a minimum buy back amount of at least 1 Note and subsequent integral multiples of 1 Note, by submitting a written request to the Issuer. The investor’s request to sell the Notes must be submitted to the Issuer no later than 1:00 p.m. Singapore time on the day of the intended sale that is a Scheduled Trading Day (the “Buy-Back Date”). The Note Executed Price for the Notes will be determined by the Market Agent at its sole discretion at the relevant time on the Buy-Back Date, and notified to the investor as soon as practicable after the later of the Scheduled Closing Times of the Exchanges. In respect of each Note, the Issuer will pay the Note Executed Price to the Noteholder no later than three Payment Days after the relevant Buy-Back Date. For avoidance of doubt, the Note Executed Price determined by the Market Agent may differ from the indicative bid price of the Notes quoted by the Issuer (if any). To the extent that the Issuer is prevented for any reason whatsoever from dealing in the Underlying Equity, investors’ requests to sell the Notes will be effected on a “first-come-first-served” basis.</BuyBackArrangements>

            <Title>Not a traditional deposit</Title>
            <Description>The Notes carry risks not normally associated with ordinary bank deposits. The investor should therefore not treat the Notes as a substitute for ordinary savings or time deposits. The Notes are not equivalent to a time deposit and are not a protected deposit by the Deposit Protection Scheme in Hong Kong or by any other similar scheme in any country.</Description>

        <RiskFactor>
            <Title>Suitability</Title>
            <Description>A prospective investor in any equity-linked Notes should be experienced with dealing in these types of products and should understand the risks associated with dealing in such products. A prospective investor should reach an investment decision only after careful consideration, with advisers (where appropriate), of the suitability of the Notes in light of the investor’s particular financial position, experience, objectives and other relevant circumstances, the information regarding the Notes, the particular Underlying Equity to which the Notes relate, any related transaction costs, and the creditworthiness of the Issuer.</Description>
        </RiskFactor>
        <RiskFactor>
            <Title>Market Risks</Title>
            <Description>Investing in equity-linked Notes involves market risk. Changes in the price, level or value of the Underlying Equity can be unpredictable, sudden and large. Such changes may result in the price or value of the Notes moving adversely to the interests of the investor and negatively impacting upon the return on, or redemption of, the Notes. In extreme circumstances, the investor may lose all, or a significant proportion of, the original investment. The Issuer and/or its affiliates may enter into hedging transactions in the market to enable the Issuer to fulfill its obligations under the Notes. These transactions typically involve contracts for the purchase and/or sale of the Underlying Equity and the establishment of long and/or short positions in the Underlying Equity which may be constantly adjusted. The unwinding or adjustment of the positions in the Underlying Equity shortly before a fixing date may affect the closing market price of the relevant Underlying Equity recorded on such date, particularly if there is otherwise low trading volume in the relevant Underlying Equity at that time. It is thus possible that this activity could affect the closing market price of the relevant Underlying Equity, whether by pushing it down to a level below or up above the relevant stipulated benchmark (as the case may be) or otherwise, resulting in the Final Redemption Amount being less than the original investment amount or no payment of interest or other return, or a reduced return. The investor takes the risk that he may not receive 100 per cent. of the original investment amount on the Maturity Date.</Description>
        </RiskFactor>
        <RiskFactor>
            <Title>Credit risk</Title>
            <Description>The Notes are not secured by any collateral. The investor is taking on the credit risk of DBS Bank Ltd. (“Bank”) (Moody’s Aa1, S&P AA-, Fitch AA-) with respect to all payments due under the Notes. The investor should not solely rely on the long-term credit ratings of the Issuer when evaluating its creditworthiness. There is no assurance that the Issuer’s long-term credit ratings as set out in this document will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be revised, suspended or withdrawn in the future if, in the relevant credit rating agency’s judgment, the circumstances so warrant. In the worst case scenario, where the Issuer becomes insolvent, the investor will lose his original investment amount.</Description>
